# TODO Create Variables
#   - Create the following variables:
#   - my_first_name
#       - Set this equal to your first name (e.g., "John").
#   - my_last_name
#       - Set this equal to your last name (e.g., "Doe").
#   - my_year_of_birth
#       - Set this equal to your birth year (use a year less than 100 years ago, e.g., 1995).
#   - current_year
#       - Set this equal to 2020.

# Example:
# my_first_name = "John"
# my_last_name = "Doe"
# my_year_of_birth = 1995
# current_year = 2020


# TODO String Indexing
#   - Print the following items (one per line) using variables:
#       - Your first name  
#       - Your last name
#       - First letter of your first name (use the +index)
#       - Second letter of your last name (use the -index)
#       - First two letters of your first name (use the +index)
#       - Last two letters of your last name (use the -index)

# Example:
# If my_first_name = "John" and my_last_name = "Doe"
# Output:
# John
# Doe
# J
# o
# Jo
# oe


# TODO Combining Strings
#   - Print the following items (one per line) using variables:
#       - Your first name and last name combined (e.g., "John Doe").
#       - Your first name repeated six times (e.g., "JohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohn").


# TODO Formatting Strings
#   - Print the following items (one per line) using variables:
#       - "<first name> <last name> -was born in- <year of birth>".
#       - "<first name> <last name> -was born in- <year of birth>. <first name> -enjoyed celebrating- <current year>".

# Example:
# If my_first_name = "John", my_last_name = "Doe", my_year_of_birth = 1995, and current_year = 2020:
# Output:
# John Doe -was born in- 1995
# John Doe -was born in- 1995. John -enjoyed celebrating- 2020


# TODO Escape Characters
#   - Print the following items (one per line) using variables:
#       - "<first name>'s birth year is <year of birth>" (use the possessive apostrophe).
#       - "\t<last name> <current year>" (use a tab character before the last name).

# Example:
# Output:
# John's birth year is 1995
#     Doe 2020


# TODO String Methods
#   - Print the following items (one per line) using variables:
#       - Your first name and last name in lower case.
#       - The length of your last name.
#       - Your first name and last name in all upper case.

# Example:
# If my_first_name = "John" and my_last_name = "Doe":
# Output:
# john doe
# 3
# JOHN DOE


# OPTIONAL CHALLENGE:
#   - Write a program that calculates your current age using current_year and my_year_of_birth.
#   - Create a sentence that says "<first name> is <age> years old."
